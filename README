== middleclass-commons

This is a small middleclass plug-in that makes it possible to use middleclass with Class-Commons (https://github.com/bartbes/Class-Commons)

In order to make middleclass compliant with Class-Common's specs, you must download and install middleclass-commons right after you do the same with middleclass:


    require 'middleclass'
    require 'middleclass-commons'


And then you are good to go.

== tests

The tests on this repo are a copy of Class-Common's . They might not be the latest version.

Use this command to execute the tests:

    lua tests.lua middleclass

That should do it.
